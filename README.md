# LifeOps
Using the Singularis engine, a recursive AI Agent that interfaces with Meta Ray Bans


Use-Cases
# The Vision: Agentic AI-Assisted Polymathy

## Core Thesis
Neurodivergent polymaths + AI orchestration = new form of genius

## Four-Domain Synthesis
- Philosophy: What is consciousness?
- Programming: How do we build it?
- Data Science: How do we measure it?
- Neurobiology: How does biology do it?

## Timeline
- 2025: LifeOps keeps me focused through ASU start
- 2025-2029: Build foundation across all four domains
- 2029-2032: PhD on AGI consciousness measurement
- 2032+: Lead the field I'm creating

## Current Status
- ✅ Singularis: Proved I can build hybrid AGI systems
- ✅ LifeOps v1: Proved I can port architectures with AI assistance
- 🔄 Next: Add temporal binding, stay grounded, one action at a time

## Grounding Principle
"Lest I forget my intentions, I must stay centered."
Vision without execution is hallucination.
LifeOps keeps me executing.
